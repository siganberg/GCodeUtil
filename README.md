# GCodeModifier (Obsolete)

Please use the ToolChange Modifier instead that can be found here:

https://www.franciscreation.com/utility/tschanger.html

Or here if you want to download the HTML version: 

https://github.com/siganberg/tsmodifier

The new HTML is much simplier and no need to install anything.
